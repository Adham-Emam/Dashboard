**üìò General Project Overview**
=====================================

The ERP API is a backend system designed to manage and integrate various aspects of an organization's operations, including user management, inventory control, sales, and more. The API is built using Django and Django REST Framework (DRF), providing a robust and scalable architecture for handling complex business logic.

**Core Features and Purpose:**

* User management: authentication, authorization, and role-based access control
* Inventory management: product tracking, stock levels, and order management
* Sales management: order processing, invoicing, and payment tracking
* Integration with other systems: API endpoints for seamless integration with third-party services

**Technologies Used:**

* Django: a high-level Python web framework for building scalable and maintainable applications
* Django REST Framework (DRF): a powerful toolkit for building RESTful APIs
* Python 3.x: the programming language used for development
* SQLite/PostgreSQL: database management systems for storing and retrieving data

**üß± Project Structure**
==========================

The project is organized into the following apps/modules:

* `users`: handles user authentication, authorization, and profile management
* `inventory`: manages products, stock levels, and orders
* `sales`: handles order processing, invoicing, and payment tracking
* `api`: defines API endpoints for interacting with the system
* `settings`: stores project-wide settings and configurations

Each app/module has its own `models.py`, `views.py`, `serializers.py`, and `urls.py` files, which define the data models, business logic, API endpoints, and URL routing for that app.

**‚öôÔ∏è Environment & Setup Instructions**
==========================================

### Cloning the Repository

 Clone the repository using Git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/erp-api.git
```
### Setting up a Virtual Environment

Create a new virtual environment using `python -m venv`:
```bash
python -m venv erp-api-env
```
Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source erp-api-env/bin/activate
```
### Installing Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using `pip`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Setting up the `.env` File

Create a new `.env` file in the project root directory and add the following variables:
```makefile
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
```
Replace `your-secret-key` with a random secret key.

### Running Migrations and Starting the Development Server

Run the database migrations:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
Start the development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
**üîí Authentication**
=====================

The API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. To obtain a token, send a `POST` request to the `/token/` endpoint with your username and password:
```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8000/token/ \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"username": "your-username", "password": "your-password"}'
```
Response:
```json
{
  "access": "your-access-token",
  "refresh": "your-refresh-token"
}
```
Use the `access` token to authenticate subsequent requests.

* `POST /users/`: Create a new user
* `GET /users/{id}/`: Retrieve a user by ID
* `PUT /users/{id}/`: Update a user
* `DELETE /users/{id}/`: Delete a user

### Inventory App

**üß™ Testing the API**
=======================

Use Postman or cURL to test the API endpoints. You can also run Django tests using `python manage.py test`.

**‚öôÔ∏è Settings & Configuration**
==============================

The project uses the following custom settings:

* `REST_FRAMEWORK`: defines the REST framework settings
* `CORS`: enables CORS support
* `DATABASES`: defines the database
